# 📘 CompareText App

The **CompareText App** is a React + TypeScript-based tool that allows you to **compare two texts** and see the **differences** clearly.  
Added text is highlighted in **green** 🟩 and removed text is highlighted in **red** 🟥.  
If you change the text after comparing, the app shows a **re-compare indicator** 🔄.
